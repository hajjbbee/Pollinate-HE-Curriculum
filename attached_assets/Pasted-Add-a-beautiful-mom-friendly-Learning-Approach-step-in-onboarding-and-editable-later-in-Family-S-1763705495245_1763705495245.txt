Add a beautiful, mom-friendly "Learning Approach" step in onboarding (and editable later in Family Settings).

For the FAMILY (one setting that applies as default):
• Slider or pretty cards to choose emphasis (they can pick multiple and rank them):
  – Child-Led / Unschooling
  – Charlotte Mason (living books, narration, nature study)
  – Montessori
  – Waldorf / Steiner (rhythm, imagination, art-first)
  – Gameschooling
  – Nature-Based / Seasonal Living
  – Inquiry-Based / Project-Based
  – Art-Based Pedagogy
  – STEAM / STEM Focus
  – Classical / Traditional (optional light academics)

PLUS a magical "Perfect Blend – surprise me!" option that dynamically mixes all of them based on the child’s interests that week (this becomes the most popular choice).

For EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD (override the family default):
• Same selector but per child
• Toggle "Use family default" ON/OFF
• Mom can say “Child A = heavy Waldorf + nature” while “Child B = full gameschooling + STEAM”

How it works under the hood:
– Store family_approaches and child_approaches[] in Supabase
– In the master curriculum prompt, inject:
  "Primary approaches for this family: Waldorf (high), Gameschooling (medium), Child-Led (high). For child Lily: override to 90% Waldorf + Nature. For child Max: 80% Gameschooling + STEAM."
– The AI now weights every suggestion, every 3 examples, every resource toward their chosen styles
– If they pick "Perfect Blend", the AI freely chooses the best match for that week’s theme and child’s mood

UI:
– Use beautiful illustrated cards with icons (paintbrush for Waldorf, dice for Gameschooling, magnifying glass for Inquiry, etc.)
– Multi-select chips with percentage sliders (or simple Low/Medium/High)
– Little preview text when they hover: "Waldorf = storytelling, beeswax modelling, seasonal festivals"
– Final card: "✨ Perfect Blend – let the AI choose what fits best each week"

In editable Family Settings, make it one click to change and instantly regenerate the next 12 weeks.
